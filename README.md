## Setting Up

This is a bog-standard rails environment.
Essentially, you need to install:


1. Ruby 2.5.3 (RVM is one way to do this)
2. PotsgreSQL
3. Bundler
4. Node.js
5. Yarn

That's it!


### Prepare the Environment

Your database needs to allow local connections.
From there, run the following commands

```bash
bundle
yarn
rails db:setup
rails s
```

You now have a working development environment.
